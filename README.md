# OpenGL-Sorting-Algorithm
Bubble sort visualizer programmed in OpenGL 3.3 _(Using GLAD and GLFW 3.3)_

Not much to say, it looks satisfying i guess. I made this because i saw others do it on the internet and also i wanted to exercise some OpenGL skills since a the time of this README's creation, i have just started learning OpenGL a few weeks back.

Build with `./bin/Makefile` for your system, `.exe` is already included because i worked on this on a windows machine.

Use `SPACE` to reset the algorithm and begin the process anew with randomized values.
